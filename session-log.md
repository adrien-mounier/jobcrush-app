## 2026-07-18 — S2 kickoff + E4 keystone shipped

**S2 design locked (grill session).** Eight product decisions fixed before writing code, recorded in
[`docs/s2-kickoff.md`](docs/s2-kickoff.md) (commit `6aef176`):

1. S2's user-facing reward is the **downloadable root CV** → the renderer must be polished.
2. Signup wall sits **immediately after the preview**; the only anonymous assets are the upload +
   preview job, so anon→account merge is one ownership update and purge is one rule.
3. Deck tiering = **stakes × uncertainty**; top ≤15 get individual yes/edit/reject cards, rest batch
   by section; an edit becomes a user-authored, auto-confirmed claim.
4. **Grill = gap-filling only**, hard-capped ~5–8 Qs; gaps detected mechanically, LLM only phrases;
   answers are confirmed facts immediately.
5. The **gate judges our pipeline, never the user's career**; thin-but-honest profiles pass; failures
   are auto-retries or precise loop-backs, never dead ends.
6. **Audit polishes / gate certifies** (audit = LLM against the cv-brain rules; gate = mechanical).
7. Root-CV review is **read-only + "fix this" loop-backs**, never a freeform editor.
8. **Path B ("no CV") is a stub in S2**; the real guided interview moved to S4 (roadmap updated).

Also added an unscheduled roadmap item: the advisory **"improve your profile"** feature (never blocks
applying) — the home for profile-strength feedback the gate deliberately withholds.

**E4 spine started — JC-32 shipped** (commit `a77f974`):

- Ran the two pre-build checks and both came back favorable: the claim miner already emits everything
  deck tiering needs (`source_quote`, `machine_touch`, `classification`, `needs_grill`/`grill_hint`,
  `role`/id-prefixes); `validate_graph.mjs` checks **structure only, no richness gate** — so a sparse
  but well-formed graph passes, exactly as decision #5 needs.
- Discovered the E4 **contract layer already existed** (oracle, `ClaimGraph` zod port, schema JSON,
  goldens — all passing). So JC-32's real gap was the **server-side builder**, not the validator port.
- Wrote `apps/api/src/graph.ts` — `buildClaimGraph(confirmedClaims, opts)` maps the deck's confirmed
  claims 1:1 into a Contract-1 `ClaimGraph` the frozen oracle accepts. Conservative by construction
  (every confirmed claim → one renderable source node, nothing dropped/invented); fills the graph-only
  fields the deck doesn't carry (provenance label, per-class risk floor so Partially-Supported keeps
  invariant 8, `confirmed_date`, one kind tag). 4 tests via the zod port (goldens prove zod ≡ oracle).
- Gate green before ship: `pnpm test` = 91 pass / 5 skipped, `pnpm typecheck` = 7/7. Pushed to `main`.

**Next:** E4 continues — claims store (JC-21, same interface + `InMemory*` pattern as `SessionStore`),
then the gate (JC-31 = `validateGraph` + trace-to-confirmed), then the root-CV renderer (JC-27).
