# Lessons — jobcrush-app

Non-obvious things worth remembering, so we don't relearn them the hard way.

## Check what already exists before assuming a ticket is greenfield

JC-32 read as "port `validate_graph.mjs` + build the graph". Half of it was already done: the oracle,
the `ClaimGraph` zod port, the schema JSON, and the goldens all landed back in S0/S1. The real gap was
just the **builder**. Grepping the contracts package first turned a "port + build" ticket into a
one-file build. Read the code the change touches before writing — the roadmap ticket describes intent,
not remaining work.

## The pipeline was designed forward-compatibly — trust it, but verify per-field

The S1 claim miner already emits `source_quote`, `machine_touch`, `classification`, `needs_grill` and
id-prefixes — everything S2's deck tiering + grill need. The forward-looking design from S1 paid off.
Still worth confirming field-by-field against the actual prompt (`claim-miner.md`) before building on
it, rather than trusting the roadmap's summary.

## Contracts must be built before vitest can resolve `@jobcrush/contracts`

Running `vitest run test/graph.test.ts` directly fails with "Failed to resolve entry for package
@jobcrush/contracts" — its `exports` point at `dist/`, which isn't built in a fresh worktree. Use
`pnpm test` (turbo builds workspace deps first) rather than raw vitest on a single file. Costs a few
seconds more but it's the same command CI runs.

## The graph validator checks structure, never richness — keep it that way

`validate_graph.mjs` validates node shape + conditional invariants only; it has no minimum-count or
"strong enough" rule. That is what lets decision #5 hold — the S2 gate judges our pipeline's work, not
the user's career, so any honest user (even a thin CV) can produce a validator-clean graph. Don't add
richness checks to the validator; profile-strength feedback belongs in the future advisory feature.
